I'm looking to make an app that I can use to download videos from website links of different social media companies. 

The user will provide a list of urls from different sites like youtube, tiktok, instagram, etc. The app will then download the videos from the urls and save them to a local directory.

I don't care if it's a web app or a desktop app.
