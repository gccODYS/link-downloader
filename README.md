2. **Copy and paste this command:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

### Step 2: Install uv (Python Package Manager)
This tool manages Python packages automatically:

1. **In Terminal, type:**
```bash
brew install uv
```
2. **Press Enter** and wait for installation

### Step 3: Download This Tool
You have two options:

**Option A: Download from GitHub (Easier)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/gccODYS/link-downloader
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Click **"Download ZIP"**
4. **Unzip the file** to your Desktop or Documents folder

**Option B: Use Git (If you know how)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gccODYS/link-downloader.git
```

### Step 4: Make the Script Executable
1. **Open Terminal**

cd ~/Desktop/link-downloader-main
```
**Common path examples:**

## Instagram Setup (One-time only)

If you want to download Instagram content, you need to get your session cookie:

1. **Log into Instagram** in your browser
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 key)
3. **Go to Application tab** ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí instagram.com
4. **Copy the `sessionid` value** (long string of letters/numbers)
5. **Create config file:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/gallery-dl
```
6. **Edit `~/.config/gallery-dl/config.json`:**
```json
{
    "extractor": {
        "instagram": {
            "cookies": {
                "sessionid": "PASTE_YOUR_SESSION_ID_HERE"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** Instagram cookies expire every few weeks. If Instagram downloads stop working, repeat these steps.

## What Works

- ‚úÖ **YouTube** - Always works
- ‚úÖ **Instagram** - Requires session cookie setup (see above)
- ‚úÖ **TikTok** - Usually works
- ‚úÖ **Twitter/X** - Usually works  
- ‚ùå **Frame.io** - Doesn't work (needs authentication)

## Troubleshooting

**Instagram suddenly stops working?**
‚Üí Your cookie expired. Redo the Instagram setup steps above.

**Script won't run?**
‚Üí Make sure you have `uv` installed and the script is executable: `chmod +x downloader_hybrid.py`

**Script is slow to start?**
‚Üí Normal! It checks for the latest scraper versions each time to stay ahead of anti-scraping measures.

## Technical Notes

- Self-contained script using PEP 723 metadata
- Automatically downloads latest yt-dlp and gallery-dl versions
- No manual dependency management needed
